Basics: 
Hello and welcome to java fundamentals and DSA documentation, I'm elated that you reached here and hope that you'll find it informative.
before diving in, let's take a moment to learn basics of programming, we all have used a computer in our lives at some point of time, we tell it to 
do something and it does but how does it do it?, has someone given it instructions to perform that task? well yes, See computer is a very dumb machine, it can only do 
something which it is told to do. It doesn't do anything on it's own. following this there are two definitions "a set of instructions givrn to a computer is known as a program"
and  "the process of telling computer what to do OR writing instructions for it is called programming". now that it's out of the way, I want you to know that computers really 
don't understand the languages we humans use for communication, it understands only two instructions i.e. 0 and 1 which means "ON" or "OFF". So anything you want to tell
the computer has to be in the form of 0s and 1s.

Languages:
Languages are the medium of communication and that holds true for computers as well. The strings of 0s an 1s that they understand is called "Binary Lanuage". 
the language in which programs are written are called "programming languages". There are three types of programming languages: Low level, assembly level, and high level.
Low level language is basically binary language and is the fastest becausse it is the language of computers and requiers no translation whatsoever.
Assembly language is the one which contains a few english words but is still very close to binay language and is bit slower than the former.
High level languages are the ones which contain numerous english words and are most readable for humans, but are the slowest among the three as they require translation.
for example java, C++, python, Ruby, Kotlin etc.
